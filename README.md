- Migrate the UI to Jetpack compose
- Sort books by Title, Year .etc

## Usage

Feel free to clone the project and build it yourself. Or if you're feeling lazy, grab the apk from [releases](https://github.com/shahimclt/booksy/releases) and get going.

## Design Process

The app was designed using Adobe XD (with some "help" from Dribble). [Download the XD file here](https://github.com/)
