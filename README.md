## Usage

Feel free to clone the project and build it yourself. Or if you're feeling lazy, grab the latest apk from [releases](https://github.com/shahimclt/booksy/releases) and get going.

PS: The app looks better if you turn ON dark mode. 


## Features

* Login using your google account (more services coming soon)
* Browse & Search for Books
* Get extended info including summary, publisher ratings and author info
* Buy books and add them to bookshelf.
* Read books in the app.

... and ...

* Dark mode support for Android 10
* Adaptive icons support
* Smooth transitions between pages

## Ideas for the future

- The app could do with some loading animations while fetching data
- Migrate the UI to Jetpack compose
- Sort books by Title, Year .etc
- Integrate with an ISBN api like Openlibrary or Amazon

## Design Process

The app was designed using Adobe XD (with some "help" from Dribble). In fact, I happened to be developing a very similar app as a personal hobby. So it was just a matter of adapting the design.

You can Download the XD file [from the releases page](https://github.com/shahimclt/booksy/releases)
