## Some random thoughts

- This project was coded hastily in Java just before I switched to Kotlin, So Im planning to rewrite this with Kotlin, MVVM, Jetpack, and maybe even Room just because.
- The activity transitions are still a little glitchy. `//TODO` for later. Hoping Switching to the new Material motion will solve it

## Usage

Feel free to clone the project and build it yourself. Or if you're feeling lazy, grab the apk from [releases](https://github.com/shahimclt/booksy/releases) and get going.

## Design Process

The app was designed using Adobe XD (with some "help" from Dribble). [Download the XD file here](https://github.com/)
